`Programme Description`
- The Erasmus Mundus European Master in Distributed Computing was approved by the EU-commission in July 2009. It is a cooperation between Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, Instituto Superior Tecnologico (IST) in Portugal and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). It is a two-year Master's programme including built-in mobility for the students. The EMDC aims at giving the best possible foundation for a career in research and development of scalable and reliable distributed systems. After the program, students should not only understand and be able to use large distributed systems but they should be capable of designing and constructing such systems. The programme comprises three semesters of course work and one semester for thesis work, 120 ECTS in total. For the first year of studies, students enter at IST or UPC, where courses cover the core aspects of distributed computing with tailored specializations. The specific profiles offered at IST and UPC address two different sets of concerns in design, development, evaluation, and evolution of distributed computing systems: overall system reliability at IST (fault-tolerance, interoperability, autonomic systems), performance and scalability at UPC (performance measurement, tuning, large-scale systems). The third semester is completed at KTH and contains advanced courses that integrate the contents of previous semesters. This motivates students to develop large-scale projects integrating both common and complementary skills acquired earlier, and developing research methodology and scientific writing, essential to pursue further studies and research. The programme concludes with a master’s thesis supervised by one of the three institutions.

`Programme Description`
- In 2004 Queen Mary teamed up with Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) to offer an innovative set of jointly run degree programmes in telecommunications systems and networks. The partnership is equally balanced in every sense – students graduate with two degrees - from BUPT and from the Queen Mary. Established in 1955 Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications is globally renowned for its ground-breaking research and teaching in the field of Telecommunications, Electronic Engineering and Computing.  It is officially designated a ‘Key University’ by the Ministry of Education – a privilege conferred only to China’s top 100 institutions – and in January 2013 it was officially ranked as being the top university in China for Information and Telecommunications Engineering.  Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary can trace its origin back s to the establishment of the Electrical Engineering  Department in 1888 and has always enjoyed a reputation for academic excellence, resulting in the two institutions being perfectly matched. The programme was developed to give students the combined academic expertise of both institutions and therefore the strengths of two distinct educational cultures – the mathematical and scientific rigour found in China and the emphasis placed on creative problem-solving and transferable skills in the UK. The two institutions’ strong links with industry are reflected in the programmes, as is their absolute commitment to training world-class professionals.  The international nature of the telecommunications industry, and the size and influence of China, mean students’ knowledge and understanding of local conditions are hugely attractive to employers.
